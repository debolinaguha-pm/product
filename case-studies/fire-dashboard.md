# üë©‚Äçüöí  Fire & Smoke Detection Dashboard Design

**Designing for High-Stakes Usability Across Industries**

---

### Overview

This project focused on building a wireframed prototype of a modular AI dashboard for fire and smoke detection ‚Äî adaptable to related safety use cases like PPE compliance, ANPR, and FRS. The goal was to create a system intuitive enough for diverse users (from factory floor staff to hospital security) to take swift, informed action in high-risk situations.

### My Role

I led the UX wireframing and collaborated across teams to ensure that user needs ‚Äî especially in emergency and safety contexts ‚Äî directly informed the interface.

- **Client Insights to Design Strategy**
    
    Through conversations with stakeholders across sectors (industrial, healthcare, security), I learned that the most valued AI applications are those that:
    
    - Enhance **onsite safety**
    - **Automate repetitive monitoring tasks**
    - Improve **operational productivity**
    
    I distilled these needs into design principles for the dashboard.
    
- **Wireframe Design & UX Flows**
    
    Designed a low-friction, modular dashboard that prioritized:
    
    - Minimalism: clean visuals, low text density
    - Step clarity: at every step, users know what to do next
    - Rapid response: optimized UI for fast decision-making in emergencies
- **Modular Framework**
    
    Created a re-usable dashboard architecture that could flexibly support:
    
    - Fire & Smoke detection
    - PPE compliance
    - Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
    - Facial Recognition Systems (FRS)
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
    
    Worked closely with software developers to transition the wireframes into a working prototype, providing feedback during development and testing different scenarios to refine edge cases.

### Outcome

- Delivered a wireframe system that formed the foundation for a scalable safety dashboard product line.
- Enabled reusability across AI monitoring solutions, reducing future design and dev effort.
- Helped surface and solve early user experience pain points before deployment.
- Reinforced user trust by making a high-risk system feel usable and accessible.

### Key Tools & Methods

- Figma (for modular design components)
- Scenario-based user flow testing
- Stakeholder interviews (industrial, healthcare, security)
- Human-centered design thinking
- Collaboration with frontend/backend engineers

### Reflections

Designing for safety-critical situations taught me that **clarity is not a luxury ‚Äî it‚Äôs a requirement.** Interfaces in these environments must work under pressure, with minimal ambiguity. My biggest learning was how much **user confidence** hinges on interface simplicity and guided interaction ‚Äî especially when tech is unfamiliar but the stakes are high.
