## About Me

With a background in integrative physiology and hands-on product experience, I work at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and human-centered design. Currently at Asadel Technologies, I collaborate with AI/ML engineers, UX teams, and domain experts to shape thoughtful, data-driven solutions for real-world problems.

I’m especially drawn to emerging tech in elder care and neurocognitive health — areas where design, science, and empathy converge.

Beyond work, I enjoy exploring cognitive science, reading about behavioral design, and simplifying complex ideas through structured thinking.
