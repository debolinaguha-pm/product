*Voice-Assisted Screening for Geriatric Cognitive Decline*

---

## Overview

We developed a web-based, voice-assisted tool aimed at early dementia screening for geriatric users. The application used structured audio and video tests to help predict cognitive status â€” classifying patients as Normal, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), or Dementia â€” based on extracted acoustic and facial features. The goal was to support clinicians and caregivers with an accessible, non-invasive early screening tool, without replacing formal clinical assessments like MMSE or CDR.

## My Role

I contributed across the research, data, and collaboration lifecycle:

- **Research & Test Design**
    
    Conducted domain-specific research on speech and facial markers in dementia. Collaborated with a senior geriatric doctor and psychologist to finalize test protocols that would yield meaningful, consistent behavioral signals.
    
- **Data Collection & Processing Oversight**
    
    Worked closely with psychologists during hospital-based data collection to ensure:
    
    - Patient recordings were complete and standardized.
    - Metadata (age, gender, diagnosis) was consistent across formats.
    - Unusable samples (e.g., with missing modalities or corrupt audio/video) were filtered early in the pipeline.
- **Cross-functional Communication**
    
    Acted as the bridge between:
    
    - Medical stakeholders (hospitals, doctors, psychologists),
    - Technical teams (ML engineers, frontend/backend developers), and
    - Product goals.
    Translated clinical requirements into actionable tech features, resolved misalignments, and helped prioritize roadmap deliverables.
- **QA & Iterative Testing**
    
    Tested multiple versions of the application â€” across frontend interactions and backend processing â€” to ensure:
    
    - Instructions were intuitive for elderly users.
    - Audio/video capture modules functioned reliably under real-world constraints.
    - Feedback loops with engineers were rapid and specific.

## Outcome

- Facilitated collection of a clean and structured multi-modal dataset in collaboration with healthcare professionals.
- Informed model feature selection by identifying audio and visual parameters relevant to early dementia symptoms.
- Strengthened product-clinician alignment by translating user needs into product priorities.
- Enabled faster iteration cycles by reducing communication gaps between medical and technical teams.

## Key Tools & Methods

- Research synthesis on acoustic & facial markers in dementia
- Stakeholder management across clinical and technical domains
- Manual data triage (audio/video integrity checks)
- Functional QA for voice-assisted user flows

## Reflections

This project deepened my understanding of building health-tech products in collaboration with domain experts, especially in sensitive spaces like elder care. It also highlighted the importance of product intuition beyond design â€” from aligning diverse stakeholders to navigating messy real-world data.
